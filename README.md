# EUvsVirus-insider

INSIDER works as an easing platform where volunteers can connect with the people that need help for combating the COVID-19, in a more effective and efficient manner. Since the restrictions appeared and the lockdown was installed, it became harder to continue the normal activities one had before. Digital life blooms as we speak, and it stands in our hands to make it reachable to everybody.

INSIDER focuses on the potential workflow that one can make to help the institutions in his area, becoming a common effort in fighting the virus and fulfilling the minuses one system can have at the moment of speaking. Start-ups, ONGs, companies, all together united can exchange their assets directly in order to:

- Give know-how, assist and support individualsâ€™ operations and activities

- Provide materials, financial funds, essential products (masks, equipment 

- Donate blood

- Receive valuable information about the emergencies, most affected areas

- Volunteer in different aspects, as: driver, courier, 3D print operator

Volunteers that join INSIDER and accomplish tasks active on the platform, can receive, apart for the amazing feeling of belonging and usefulness, InsidePoints, in order to get a higher rank in the National and European Classament of Volunteers. To maximize the succes, we introduce local businesses in the gamification system, which enables volunteers to redeem discounts of different kinds.

This project was submitted fo the EUvsCovid European Hackathon.
